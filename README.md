Unofficial Patch for NVMP

Changelog

Patch Final

( Ultimate just means it's finalized, it's not dlc )

https://github.com/CaesarNVMP/freer...fe977407/esps/ServerPatchFreeroamULTIMATE.esm

Cut stun grenades now in circulation, can be bought from traders, they temporarily blind the opponent when caught in the radius or looking in their direction, after you throw look away to not be blinded , located in the games editor, brought into circulation, should help with the explosive griefing issue and provide a means of quick escape

Cut gas grenades now in circulation, they cause the opponent to gradually lose health for 10 seconds upon exposure. They work like mustard gas, located in the games editor, previously marked unplayable, they made a brief appearance in birds of a feather quest.

These two grenades should help with the explosives issue in getting away from such opponent with launchers and stuff.

Raul's armor can be purchased from crimson at a random chance, and the sombrero can be bought from chet at a random chance.              ( Nice sombrero and nice looking armor found in the games editor, originally intended for raul but was cut, tested in singleplayer and the outfit comes free of any bugs and was included into the patch!)

General Performance/Stability tweaks


Patch V50 

You can now exit doc Mitchell's house through the boarded up backdoor as a fix for not being able to exit doc mitchell when tutorial stuff is disabled. It serves as a failsafe door for when the other door doesn't function

Patch V49 - Fully cleaned file, forgot to delete some duplicated records.

Patch V47-48 

Added first recon beret to manny's room ( unobtainable originally as quest npc filtered out ) 

Cut Raul Hat and Outfit can be purchased from 188 

Enclave Armor from fallout 3 ( not seen in-game but present in the geck/games editor ) can be found in remnants bunker , with DT set to match t51b, many  fallout 3 outfits are in the editor, such as the chinese stealth armor which is already located in the game!

Remnants armor I originally placed removed from bunker.

Patch V46: Final until approved/any other issues validated.

Final missing unobtainable/quest outfits implemented: Benny's suit scavengable, formal top hat, etc
General performance improvements twice that of the vanilla game.

Patch V45

CHANGES
Brahmin companion for traders removed due to the fact they would possibly (unknown yet) bug out if there was NPC sync ( they would try following everyone ) ((((REMOVED))))

Automatic Boomer dialogue disabled , now all automatic dialogue popups are disabled and shouldn't interfere with freeroam PVP :) ( Boomers can now be safely put back in the game, also reducing CTD due to removed NPCs crashing the game as we already know )

More performance increase and CTD/Stutter reduced than the vanilla game.

Trigger/Script fixes

Automatic XP at tops and sunset sasparilla disabled. No more level up abuse
File cleaned/checked for errors as usual


Patch V44 Racemenu tool removed as i was informed that when character data is eventually synced, as the tool is local, you would affect everyone's elses appearance in the process. ((((REMOVED)))) 

Patch V43
Cell did not have fast travel disabled, everywhere has fast travel disabled now

Patch V42
General performance and stability improvements

Patch V41
Pack Brahmin companion in goodsprings for trader factions, bare in mind it will not show up until the NV:MP team un-whitelist pack brahmin ((((REMOVED))))

Benny's bunker now has an exit point instead of opening a door into nothingness, the interior was unfinished, i fixed that, the interior is actually located in vault 34, so it's just a door to th e same location pretty much .

Patch V40
General Performance and Stability improvements

Patch V39
RE-Enabled cut scenery as it actually turns out they were in the game up until the DLC Patches where obsidian disabled some things for the xbox 360 and PS3 versions, and as a result the PC had to get the same treatment due to each update released being the same on all platforms, as they were apart of the vanilla experience I feel it is safe to bring this element back into the game.
( RESTORING THIS ALSO FIXED DIRTY EDITS LEFT BY OBSIDIAN , AND IMPROVED PERFORMANCE/REDUCED CTD around the map and in these specific locations. ((( Important, was necessary to fix crashes and dirty edits left behind by obsidian in specific areas of the map, e.g performance increase )))

Invisible barriers also removed to increase performance, so many barriers cluttered the map, this also allows for a true freeroam experience being able to explore the map limitlessly, terrain outside the map was also fixed to prevent people getting stuck in specific areas/rocks  ( this took so long god damn, the entire map out there is massive! ) 

Patch V38
General Performance/stability improvements

Patch V37
Cleaned up old form IDs

Patch V36- ( restored race menu from patch 31-36 changes, restored wild wasteland integration , main menu bug appears to be external as it is not happening in closed server. It was proven it was not the patch because even without the patch, dieing took you back to the main menu, it's possible a client update is causing this )

Patch V31:
All Lucky38 floors now accessible by elevator

Automatic dialogue NPCs no longer auto dialogue with player ( legion explorers, ncr troopers, mr holdout ) ( should solve the problem with npc dialogue popup in combat, however i could not change automatic popup from assassins as the hitsquad scripts are very dependant on them, disabling the dialogue encounter could break the game if i had done that )

Wild Wasteland Intergration

Adds in more unobtainable weapons:

Corporal Sterlings Rifle ontop of a desk in mccarran outside. (Was completely unobtainable)
Liberator in Nelson barracks (Was completely unobtainable) 

Patch V29: General performance improvements + clean

Patch V28: General performance improvements


Patch V27: Welcome to NVMP quest and autogives you the racemenu tool! (((REMOVED))))

Patch V26.2: No more CTDs caused by this patch, file is fully cleaned up. All CTDs that happen are to do with the client/framework as expected.

Patch V26 Fixed a CTD i accidentally caused around hoover dam by mistakenly deleting a file dependant on the final battle/dam's event processing, was a mistake and a file that accidentally got caught in the crossfire.

Patch V25 Changes: Cleaned up duplications

Patch V24 Changes: Cleaned up the file more thoroughly and deleted old form ID's.

Patch V23 Changes: Fixed a glitch i accidentally caused that made the veteran legionary wear the prime legionary helmet, I accidentally dragged a loot listing into another's listing by accident, while trying to inspect a form

Patch V22 Changes: Popups appear one time only now per game/server play/life (((removed)))

Patch V21 Changes: Papa khans leather armour and helmet on papa khans bed


Patch :V20 Changes - Legate's armour now counts as faction armour so enemy factions to the legion turn hostile, also has a repair list and can be repaired with legion apparel. All other NCR/Legion armours were already faction tagged however. Only the two story factions appear to have this setting. Damwar facemask has a chance of being found in lockers. All damwar outfits are now playable.


Power Armour reset to vanilla stats due to people not liking the change ( REMOVED!!! thought having PA all the same stats would make it balanced but clearly this was not wanted ) 

Artillery at nellis disabled so it can be used as a faction's headquarters to whoever controls it. 


Fast Travel Disabled as the dev team wanted / intended. ( as you wanted  :)  )

Full changes: Fixes Inaccessible Locations
( The fort. Legate camp, oliver's compound, Boulder city, lucky38, Gomorrah, silver rush, hoover dam checkpoint/eastern side, securitron vault in the fort weather station ) ( Entire map is now accessible, woopee ) 

Fixes BOS bunker randomly locking
Fixes Doc Mitchell tutorial error

Adds in uobtainable clothing, e.g. Faction leader outfits to their respective locations. Caesar's robes on his table, Legate's apparel in the war tent, Elders robes at Mcnamara's desk, General/Kimball outfits in oliver's compound , etc , Makes the damwar facewrap, slave backpack, damwar outfits playable. Adds in remenants PA to the remnants bunker. Adds eulogy jones suit to freeside where rotface sits, for all you pimps out there. ( Rotface wears eulogy suit when you give him enough caps , so it was the ideal locations ) 

Adds kings suit at the kings chair.


Restores Cut Gate between the fort and the legate camp to make the area more linear, allows two ways for players to reach the fort so they won't have long trek to the cove to get there and it means the legion will be able to organize wars over the dam with the NCR, being able to train in the legate's camp and launch attacks on the defending NCR at the dam from the legate's camp/legion side
